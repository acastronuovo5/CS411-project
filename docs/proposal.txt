The user enters in some information about their friend as well as their twitter profile. The app then uses the Twitter API to read the friends tweets and determine the friend’s interests, then using a mix of the interests found on twitter and the user inputted information, calls the Amazon Product Advertising API to find items the user’s friend may like. The program’s output is a list of items that the user could buy their friend as a gift. 
We will cache the user's information in a database, and also require the user to login using their Twitter account.
