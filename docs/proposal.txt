The user enters in some information about their friend as well as their twitter profile. The app then uses the Twitter API to read the friends tweets and determine the friend’s interests, then using a mix of the interests found on twitter and the user inputted information, calls the Google Places API to find stores which sell gifts the user’s friend may like. The program’s output is a list of locations that the user could go to in order to find their friend a gift. 
We will cache the user's information in a database, and also require the user to login using their Twitter account.
