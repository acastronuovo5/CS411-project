US1: Login into the app

- As a user I want to login with my twitter account login information so that I am able to use an app to find the best gift for my friend.

- The user will open the app to the login page and be asked to log in using their twitter account information.

- Once they add their  information, either a successful login will occur which will lead to showing the app’s dashboard for that user, or an unsuccessful login will occur (US1.1).

- Once the user has logged in successfully, the dashboard is displayed. The dashboard will show that user’s past activity in the app (recent friend picks/store suggestions)

- There will also be a button to Start a New Friend Match, New Gift Match (for existing friend) and Delete a Past Match.
