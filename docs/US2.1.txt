US2.1: Account Inputted Doesnâ€™t Work

- In user story 2, the user has selected which twitter username they would like to use to match gifts to.

- If the username is not found, does not have enough tweets and/or likes, or the account is private, the program will output which problem the inputted username has, and ask the user to input a new twitter profile.

- This resets the user to the beginning of user story 2.
