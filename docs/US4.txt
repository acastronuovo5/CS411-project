US4: Receiving list of recommendations

- As a user, I want to see the list of recommended stores for gifts of a certain category for my friend so that I can choose the best option.

- After doing the ‘user log in story’, the ‘enter twitter story’ and the ‘enter friends info story’, the user will wait a few moments for the recommendation system to run. 

- Then, the user will be presented with a list of recommended locations to go to buy gifts - listed in order from most highly recommended to shop at for their friend to least recommended. 

- These locations will have an image of the store, the name, a description, tags (outdoors, social, etc) as well as a hyperlink to the place via Google.

- Each item will have a thumbs up / thumbs down icon, allowing the user to quickly give feedback on the item so the algorithm can make better recommendations  


This is the final user story, it is where the user receives the end product of the software.
